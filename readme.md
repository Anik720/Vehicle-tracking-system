### Back-end 

- The back-end is implemented in Node.js.
- It provides mock APIs for the front-end to update vehicle positions and statuses.

### Real-time Updates

- Real-time updates are achieved using socketio real-time technology.
- Vehicle markers and statuses on the map are updated dynamically.

### Filters

- Filters are implemented to allow users to view vehicles that meet specific conditions (e.g., moving, idle).

### graph

- A  eature includes a simple graph or chart that displays metrics like the distance covered by each vehicle over time.
